### Features
 - MIDI through USB
 - "real" signal bypass
 - Control analog pots through MCU

### TODO
- [ ] Figure out how to use digipot with negative or unregolated voltages (i.e. guitar line-in signal)
- [ ] choose best digipots
- [ ] BOM for analog components

### Development Unit
- Use Nucleo or Discovery devkit from STM. Requirements:
  - target USB port
- implement analog circuitry onto a vanilla Arduino shield
  - also real pots and digital ones?
